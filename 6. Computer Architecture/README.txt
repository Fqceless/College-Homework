--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking EGCP-3210, Computer Architecture, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This class is a Computer Engineering course that is required for all CS majors
It focuses on the lower-level of computers and how it relates to programming.
As it is focused on the lower-level stuff, some of the projects were done on CedarLogic (.cdl)
You'll need to download CedarLogic to view those files, so I have a download in this folder that *should* work.
Hope you enjoy the projects!
