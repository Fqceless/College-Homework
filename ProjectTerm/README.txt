Term Project for CS-2210, Data Structures in Java

This was the final project for this class. It was a team project, although I did 95% of the coding.
We were given every file and had to modify TwoFourTree.java to make Inserting, Deleting, and Finding elements work.
They had to handle all data types, but only needed to work with integers.

This was really tough. Handling all of the cases and making sure the tree sorts correctly is very difficult, on top of even knowing how the tree is supposed to work.
It took probably around 20+ hours of pure coding hours to get this done, on top of some much needed help from my professor.
In the end, it works exactly how it should, and looks pretty clean too. I'm sort of proud of it.

If you are in this class reading this, please, start this early. It doesn't seem overwhelming until you realize how conceptually hard this project is.
