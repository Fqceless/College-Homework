# CS-1220-HW
Homework Projects for CS-1220, Object Oriented Design in C++ at Cedarville University

--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-1220, OOD/C++, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is my archive of Homework projects I did for CS-1220 in the Spring semester of 20222.
This was my second college coding class, and it focused more on classes and more in-depth concepts in C++.
I did pretty well in this class, but unfortunatly I was also taking Calc II and Physics I, so I couldn't focus very much on this class.
Hope you enjoy parsing my code!
