--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-2210, Data Structures, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is my archive of Homework projects I did for CS-2210 in the Fall semester of 2022.
This is one of the classes that started off my sophomore year! 
Now that all of the pre-requisites are out of the way, I have time to spend on my coding classes!
This class focused on two things:
-Teaching us Java
-Teaching us Data Stuctures
Hope you enjoy the projects!
