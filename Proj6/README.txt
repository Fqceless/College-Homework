Proj6 for CS-2210, Data Structures in Java

Created a program that can walk a binary tree with In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order walks.
BinaryTree is implemented with STNodes, which have a left child and a sibling (instead of a left and right child).
We were given almost all of these files, my job was to implement ListBinaryTree (in ListBinaryTree.java)
and create the three "...Walk" classes by extending the EulerTour class.
