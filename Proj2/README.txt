Proj2 for CS-2210, Data Structures in Java

Transported the Project 1 files over to NetBeans (IDE) and created a GUI for their functions.
Project2.java and mainFrame.java are in a defaultly named package.
GCD.java, Factorial.java, and NegativeNumberException.java are in the "numeric" package.

Also updated the factorial class to throw an exception if it is given negative numbers.
mainFrame.java was created by me but through the NetBeans Swing GUI feature who pasted the foundational code for me.
