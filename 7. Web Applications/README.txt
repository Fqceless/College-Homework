If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-3220, Web Apps, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is one of the many coding classes I took in Spring of 2023.
This class focused on learning how to make web pages and websites.
Hope you enjoy the projects!

Note:
All of the projects in this class are a group project, so partial credit goes to Joshua Curry for being my group partner.
