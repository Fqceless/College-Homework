Project 1 for CS-3220, Web Applications

Re-creating ape.cedarville.edu.
The final project of this class is to fully recreate APE, so this is just a baseline.
Created a foundation with only HTML and CSS.

All of the projects in this class are a group project, so partial credit goes to Joshua Curry for being my group partner.
