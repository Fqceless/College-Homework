hi

to use, please keep all the installed packages from the git or zip https://github.com/JCurryCedarville/APE-Final-Project
codux needs most of them (not sure which ones exactly)
We were able to bring over all the privious functionality from privious projects
we even added some new stuff (Wow!)
note the use of dynamic loading to reduce to the load time of each element(it's a feature)(mouse over to load) 
not all of everything we wanted to work works but most of it is

the express server is running on port 4000
    run by "APE-Final-Project\src\MiddleWare> npm start"
    [ we have a test server at the root :) ]
    [make sure to set up sql with the provided file]

the react node runs on port 3000
    run by "APE-Final-Project> npm start"

most of the files are in 
/src (main app)
/src/components (all the fancy modules)
/src/MiddleWare (express) 

you shouldnt need codux to run it, but just in case you can find it at https://www.codux.com/

this was our first time using typescript, we had a good time.
