Homework 2 for CY-3320, Linux System Programming

In this homework, we needed to separate the functions from simple-telnet-main.c into their own separate files, compile them into assembly, and then look through the assembly files.
To complete the assignment, we needed to comment through the assembly files explaining what is going on to show our understanding of the assembly code. If possible, we could also have optimized the code, but that was not required.

I commented checkSocket.s and checkStdin.s,
Micah commented negotiate.s and readSocket.s
Our professor commented setupFds.s as an example for us
stc and sts are the executable files to test if the code is still working
