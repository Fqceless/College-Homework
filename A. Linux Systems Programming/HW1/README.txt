Homework 1 for CY-3320, Linux System Programming

Our task was to edit the execMappedFileHandout.c code to run the exeutable file given in args[1].
Professor's original README is below:

------------------------------------------------------------

Complete this assignment by editing the template code execMappedFileHandout.c

Students should edit the template code according to the contextual comments
in all places where the text "...." appears

Once complete, students can test their implementations by confirming that their
solutions provide the same output as non-debug version of the instructor-
provided executable. To run the test enter the following command:

  > execMappedFile pow

NOTE: the debug version of the executable is provided in the event that you
want additional section header and symbol table information to debug your
application. Your solution does NOT need to print the information generated
by the debug version.
