HW8 (Final Project) for CS-1220, Object-Oriented Design in C++

Made a program to simulate a circuit.
This was a group project, so I wasn't the only one working on it.

It takes a circuit file and a vector file and prints the output to the console.
We made an event class, wire class, and gate class.
The wires and the gates can talk to eachother, and they both drive the events.

We procrastinated a lot and this program was made from scratch, 
so it has a lot of bugs and doesn't work on some of the more complicated files.

Grade: 102/120
