Lab 6 for CS-3210, Programming Language Survey

Create a Bible verse look-up program (just like CS-1210 HW8 & Lab 4 of this class)
But this time in Rust!
With a couple more requirements (same as Lab 4):
-Implement book abbreviations with the .csv file
-Verse print-outs must follow 80 column rule, you must write that code yourself

Sidenote: I'm very proud of my function for printing under 80 cols. Recursion is so cool.

Grade: 100/100
