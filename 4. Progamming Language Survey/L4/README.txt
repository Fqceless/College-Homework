Lab 4 for CS-3210, Programming Language Survey

Create a Bible verse look-up program (just like CS-1210 HW8)
But this time in Python!
With a couple more requirements:
-Implement book abbreviations with the .csv file
-Verse print-outs must follow 80 column rule, you must write that code yourself
-Code must be "Pythonic" (don't just paste in your C++ code)

Sidenote: I'm very proud of my function for printing under 80 cols. Recursion is so cool.
