# CS-3210-HW
Homework Projects for CS-3210, Programming Language Survey at Cedarville University

--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-3210, PLS, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is the other coding class I took in the Fall 2022 semester.
This class focused on understanding multiple different progamming languages at a basic level.
Hope you enjoy the projects!

Note: L5 was an android studios tutorial, and that has way too many files, so they are not listed here.
It was in Kotlin if you were wondering.
