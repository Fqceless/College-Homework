Project 4 for CS-3310, Operating Systems

Created a program that can encrypt and decrypt messages into images.

--Program uses the readme, here is the message for that--
Hello, welcome to Chris LaFave's project!
You are either reading this because you purposefully opened the README,
or because your command-line arguments were incorrect.

Here is the run-down:
Encrypt:
steg -e <input picture> <output picture> [input txt file]
If no input file is present, will prompt the user to input a message

Decrypt:
steg -d <input picture> [output txt file]
If no output file is present, will output to the console

Happy encoding!
