# CS-3310-HW
Homework Projects for CS-3310, Operating Systems at Cedarville University

--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-3310, OS, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is one of the many coding classes I took in Spring of 2023.
This class focused on understanding operating systems and how they work.
This class was mostly conceptual, so there aren't that many projects.
Hope you enjoy the projects!
