Proj7 for CS-2210, Data Structures in Java

For this assignment, we were given all of these files and asked to modify the ArrayHeap.java to configure the Array-based Heap.
All I modified were the add, remove, bubbleUp, and bubbleDown methods. Also main but that was super easy.

I crammed this project and turned it in 15 mins late, so it might be pretty messy.
