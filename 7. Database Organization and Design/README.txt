# CS-3610-HW
Homework Projects for CS-3610, Database Organization & Design at Cedarville University

--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-3610, Databases, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is one of the many coding classes I took in Spring of 2023.
This class focused conceptually understanding databases and how they are made, diagramed, and function.
We also learned how to use SQL/MySQL at a foundational level.
As it was mostly conceptual, there weren't many projects.
Hope you enjoy the projects!
