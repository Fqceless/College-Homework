--YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY THESE FOR YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS CLASS--
If you somehow found this and you are taking CS-1210, C++, at Cedarville, you could get kicked out for using this.
Feel free to use it to get ideas, but DO NOT paste my code into your program.

If you are an employer or some professional person:
Welcome! This is my archive of Homework projects I did for CS-1210 in the Fall semester of 2021.
This was my first college coding class, so the projects are a little rough, but they get the job done! (Mostly!)
Feel free to look at it to get a good idea for how I code, but if you want a better idea, look at my more recent classes.
