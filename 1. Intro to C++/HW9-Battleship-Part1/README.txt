Part 1 of the final project for CS-1210, Intro to C++.

We were given the battleship.h and the battleship_main.cpp that were written by CS faculty.
We had to modify battleship_main.cpp to get a game of battleship working and playable.
Most of the comments in battleship_main.cpp were guides for our code.

battle, battleship.o, and battleship_main.o are executables.

Grade: 40/40
